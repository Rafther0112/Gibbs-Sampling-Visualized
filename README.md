# Visualization of Gibbs Sampling for 2D Gaussian distribution

Create a simple GIF to visualize how Gibbs sampling samples from a 2D Gaussian distribution.

Code accompanying my blog post: [Implementing Gibbs sampling in Python](https://mr-easy.github.io/2020-05-21-implementing-gibbs-sampling-in-python/)

Where the true distribution is:

Sampled points using Gibbs sampling and the estimated Gaussian:
